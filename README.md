# Year-wise-Hurricane-Type-prediction

## Motivation
Hurricanes are one of the very perilous disasters. Hurricanes effects more on the environment, ecosystem, agriculture and human lives too. When a hurricane strikes a coastal area, it brings a number of perilous events. These events include Tsunami, heavy rains, high winds, a storm surge and even tornadoes. In 1965 Hurricane Betsy caused 1.5 billion of property damage at Florida and the Gulf States. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina resulted in 853 recorded fatalities also in regions of Florida. Prior knowledge of the trajectories of the hurricane can save many precious lives, and help the people of the particular effected area seek alternative sources of income and farmers purchasing crop insurance to prevent them from severe loss

## Dataset
The data that we have got from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) includes time, location, wind speed, pressure which are utilized to do the prediction.
